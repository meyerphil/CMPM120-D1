###    Description: 
        Opening Studio Scene before game title screen.

###    8 Requirements 
		- 3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes)
	
	I have 3 scenes(CaveScene, StudioTitle, GameScreen) with their own Scene classes.
	Each created in their own .js files.
	
		- 2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect)
	
	In the CaveScene, I have 2 audio assets recorded by my phone.
	The first is 'Fire.wav' created by me using a ziplock bag of seeds
	to simulate the sound of the fire.
	The second audio is 'Drum.wav' which is me drumming on my desk,
	as background music for the scene.
	
		- 2+ image assets (one with transparent background)
		
	I have multiple images across multiple scenes.
	In the CaveScene, I have a shadow figure walking and a tree.
	These have a transparent background and were made using Procreate on my IPad.
	
	In the StudioTitle, I took a screenshot of my shadow figure inverted by Google Slides.
	
	In the GameScreen, I have the background of the title screen as some
	nature scenery. I drew this using Procreate on my IPad.
		
		- 2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)
	
	I had Triangles and Rectangle shapes created using Phaser3
	in the CaveScene. 
	
	These 4 shapes create the fire object.
	
		- 1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)
		
	Using Google Slides, I created fancy text for StudioTitle scene,
	'Cave Art Studios', which gives it a hand-written look.
		
		- 1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)
		
	In the GameScreen, I have two multi-line Phaser3 text objects
	for the title of the game and the select objects.
	
		- 1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
		
	Twice, between the CaveScene -> StudioTitle -> GamScreen,
	I have a fade to black transition between scenes.
		
		- 1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)
		
	In the CaveScene, I have the Fire object move from off screen using
	a tween.
	I also have the Shadow figures come in from the top of the screen
	using the same technique.
	I also added motion to the 'fire' and 'vignette' to get it a more
	flickering look.
